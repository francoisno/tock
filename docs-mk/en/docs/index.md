# Welcome to Tock - open conversational platform

<img alt="Tock logo" src="assets/images/logo.svg" style="width: 100px;">

**Tock** (*The Open Conversation Kit*) is a complete and open platform to build conversational agents - also known as _bots_. 

The [Tock.ai](https://doc.tock.ai/) site is a good starting point to learn about the solution and its growing community.

Tock does not depend on 3rd-party APIs, although it is possible to integrate with them.
Users choose which components to embed and decide to keep (or share) ownership of conversational data and models.

> Tock has been used in production for several years by [OUI.sncf](https://www.oui.sncf/services/assistant) to
> propose various assistants over its own channels (Web, mobile), social networks, as well as smart speakers.

> The platform source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock) 
> under the [Apache License, version 2.0](https://github.com/theopenconversationkit/tock/blob/master/LICENSE).

Available by phone, on the Web and WhatsApp, the bot informs and guides French population about the Covid-19, thanks to experts, partners and volunteers. [This page](about/showcase.md#allocovid) gives technical details and links to the sources. |

## Technologies

Tock runs on [JVM](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_virtuelle_Java) platforms. The reference language is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/),
 but other programming languages can be leveraged through the available APIs.
 
Tock relies on [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com ). 
Various _NLU_ libraries and algorithms can be used, such as [Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) or [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/),
but Tock does not depend on them directly.

Graphical interfaces _(Tock Studio)_ are made with [Angular](https://angular.io/) in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
